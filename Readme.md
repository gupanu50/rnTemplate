# OM REACT-NATIVE TEMPLATE

**Objective :**

React-native template aims to kick off  any  new  react-native project quickly and using this we aim to maintain consistency of structure of codebase .  We have laid out  every technology below in detail  which is used in creation of this template and their significance  so one can understand it  and start working  with no time .
We have included the best available libraries to construct this template .

# How To Run 
To run this template:-
Firstly install the node-modules by run the command:- npm install 
after this command we need to install the pods for iOS by run the command:- cd ios 
This command opens the ios folder in terminal because the podfile is present in this directory after that run:- pod install
In Android :-  npx react-native run-android
In iOS :- npx react-native run-ios
